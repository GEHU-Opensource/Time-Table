# 📚 **Timetable Scheduling Project - Research and Documentation Repository**

Welcome to the **Timetable Scheduling Project** repository! This space is dedicated to documenting all **research, findings, discussions,** and **progress** related to our project. The goal is to create an **efficient timetable scheduling system** that addresses real-world challenges in academic scheduling.

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a scheduling model that:

* **Optimally assigns** rooms, teachers, and time slots.
* Considers various **constraints** like teacher preferences, student load, room capacities, and subject assignments.
* **Handles dynamic changes**, such as adding new rooms or teachers without requiring a complete retraining of the model.
* **Simplifies complex constraints** while maintaining flexibility to adapt to real-world needs (e.g., exam scheduling).
