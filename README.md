# Timetable Scheduling Project

## 📚 Overview
Welcome to the **Timetable Scheduling Project**! This repository documents research, findings, discussions, and progress on creating an efficient timetable scheduling system that addresses real-world challenges in academic scheduling. Our goal is to develop a scheduling model that optimally assigns rooms, teachers, and time slots while accommodating various constraints.

## 🔍 Project Goals
- **Optimal Assignment**: Effectively allocate rooms, teachers, and time slots.
- **Constraint Management**: Consider teacher preferences, student load, room capacities, and subject assignments.
- **Dynamic Adaptability**: Adjust to changes, such as adding new rooms or teachers, without complete model retraining.
- **Simplicity and Flexibility**: Simplify complex constraints while remaining adaptable to real-world needs.

## 🧬 Genetic Algorithm
The project employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the scheduling problem, inspired by the principles of natural selection. Key modules in our GA include:

1. **Data Encoding and Decoding**: Converting solutions into chromosomes for efficiency.
2. **Initial Population**: Generating a diverse set of potential solutions under specified constraints.
3. **Evaluation of Population**: Using a fitness function to assess solution quality.
4. **Crossover Evolution**: Creating new solutions by combining existing ones.
5. **Mutation**: Introducing random changes to explore new potential solutions.

### Advantages
- Flexibility compared to manual systems
- Reduced processing power requirements
- Quick generation of accurate timetables
- User-friendly data entry and revision
- Improved productivity and minimal paperwork

### Disadvantages
- Requires initial raw content input
- High memory consumption
- Internet connectivity needed

## 📋 Applications
The genetic algorithm can efficiently create various timetables, including:
- University Timetable
- Exam Timetable
- School Timetable
- College Timetable
- Teacher Timetable

## 📊 Results
The system generates distinct timetables for each class, faculty member, and lab, preventing slot conflicts and allowing customization. The program meets both hard and soft scheduling constraints.

## 🚀 Future Scope
This project aims to simplify faculty management by automatically assigning courses, considering workload balance, and tracking expertise. Future enhancements may include a master schedule for departments, integration with university websites, and personalized time slot assignments.
